## üîß Overview

This project is an end-to-end **Examination System** built using SQL Server and visualized in **Power BI**, designed to track and analyze student progress, skill readiness, certifications, job placements, and employer feedback. It serves both educational institutions and HR departments with actionable dashboards and KPIs.

> üë§ **HR-Focused Contribution:** This repository documents my dedicated work on the **HR-related dashboards**, where I created a specialized **HR Data Mart** using SSIS to extract and load data from the transactional database. My contribution was scoped to the HR user perspective, involving hiring metrics, student-job matching, certification impact, and employer satisfaction. I also worked extensively with stored procedures and SSRS to support reporting.

## üèõÔ∏è 1. Database Design

### üìä Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The database was designed based on a real-world training and examination system. Major entities include:

* **Student**
* **Instructor**
* **Course**
* **Track**
* **Exam**
* **Question & Choice**
* **Certificate**
* **Job Placement**
* **Company & Department**

Relationships:

* A student belongs to a track and can earn certificates.
* Exams are linked to courses, and questions are linked to exams.
* Students can be placed in jobs through companies.

> ‚úÖ All foreign key constraints, cascading updates, and triggers were implemented to maintain referential integrity.

## üìÇ 2. Database Creation & Population

### SQL Implementation

A full schema was written in SQL to:

* Create tables
* Define relationships
* Apply constraints and triggers
* Drop/rebuild certain elements (e.g., Certificate columns, duplicate Topic table)

  


### Data Generation

Mock data was generated for each table:

* `StudentSkills`, `Job`, `StudentCertificate`, `StudentAnswer`, `StudentEnrollment`, `StudentExam` were populated with sample data.
* `Certificate` table was altered to reflect real-world formats (name and URL instead of filepath).

### üõ†Ô∏è Stored Procedures Used

* CRUD Procedures for all tables (Insert, Update, Delete, Select)
* `ExamGeneration`: Automatically creates an exam per course
* `ExamAnswers`: Saves student answers per exam
* `ExamCorrection`: Calculates student grades based on answers

## üì§ SSIS Data Transfer

To support HR-focused dashboards, I used **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)** to migrate data from the transactional examination system to a curated **HR Data Mart**. This enabled clean, role-specific reporting in Power BI.

## üìà 3. Dimensional Modelling

To support analytical dashboards in Power BI, a **Star Schema** was designed:

### ‚ú® Fact Tables:

* `FactStudentPerformance` (joins exams, grades, certifications, skills)
* `FactJobPlacement` (student-job-company mapping)
* `FactCertificationProgress` (completion status, grade, issue date)

### üìã Dimension Tables:

* `DimStudent`
* `DimTrack`
* `DimCourse`
* `DimSkill`
* `DimCertificate`
* `DimJob`
* `DimCompany`
* `DimInstructor`

Views were created in SQL to simulate fact/dimension tables and loaded into Power BI.

## üìä SSRS Reporting

In addition to Power BI dashboards, I built over **6 SSRS reports** using stored procedures. These include:

* Report showing **student info by Department No** (parameterized)
* Report returning **student grades across all courses**
* Instructor report showing **courses taught and student counts**
* Course-topic mapping report
* Report listing **exam questions and choices**
* Report that shows **student answers per exam** (freeform layout)

## üî¢ 4. Key DAX Measures

### Student Performance:

```dax
Skill Match % =
VAR SkillsAssigned = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT('StudentSkills'[SkillsText]))
RETURN DIVIDE(SkillsAssigned, 10) * 100
```

### Hiring Metrics:

```dax
Hired Count =
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('Student'[StudentID]),
    FILTER('Job', 'Job'[Status] = "Hired")
)
```

### Certification Metrics:

```dax
Avg Cert Score =
AVERAGEX(
    'StudentCertificate',
    SWITCH([Grade], "A", 4, "B", 3, "C", 2, "D", 1, 0)
)
```

### Readiness Funnel:

```dax
Completion % =
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER('StCertificationProgress', [Status] = "Completed")),
    COUNTROWS(VALUES('Student'[StudentID]))
)
```

### Recovery:

```dax
Avg Time to Recovery =
AVERAGEX(
    FILTER('StudentFlags', NOT(ISBLANK([FlagDate])) && NOT(ISBLANK([RecoveryDate]))),
    DATEDIFF([FlagDate], [RecoveryDate], DAY)
)
```

## üîÑ 5. Power BI Dashboarding
